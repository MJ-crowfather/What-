      description:
        "Schr√∂dinger's Cat is a thought experiment devised by Austrian-Irish physicist Erwin Schr√∂dinger in 1935. It's not a real experiment but an illustration of a core concept in quantum mechanics: superposition. In the scenario, a cat, a flask of poison, and a radioactive source are placed in a sealed box. If an internal monitor detects radioactivity (a random quantum event), the flask is shattered, releasing the poison that kills the cat. The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics implies that after a while, the cat is simultaneously alive and dead in a state of quantum superposition. Only when one looks in the box (i.e., makes an observation) does the cat's state collapse into being either alive or dead. This highlights the strange, non-intuitive nature of reality at the quantum level and the measurement problem.",

      description:
        "The Trojan Horse is a pivotal story from the legendary Trojan War. After a fruitless 10-year siege of the city of Troy, the Greeks devised a cunning plan. They constructed a massive wooden horse and hid a select force of their best soldiers inside. The Greek fleet then pretended to sail away in defeat. The Trojans, believing the horse to be a victory trophy and a peace offering to the gods, pulled it into their fortified city. That night, as the Trojans celebrated, the hidden Greek soldiers emerged, opened the city gates for their returning army, and the Greeks decisively conquered Troy. This story is the origin of the term 'Trojan Horse,' meaning a trick or strategy that causes a target to invite a foe into a securely protected bastion or place.",

        "Game Theory is a theoretical framework for conceiving social situations among competing players. In more rigorous terms, it is the study of mathematical models of strategic interactions among rational agents. It has applications in all fields of social science, as well as in logic, systems science and computer science. A key concept is the 'game,' which is any situation where there are multiple participants ('players') and the outcome for each player depends not only on their own actions but on the actions of others. Game theory helps explain and predict how these players will behave. It analyzes strategies, cooperation, conflict, and decision-making in a huge variety of contexts, from economics and politics to biology and psychology.",

      description:
        "CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) is a revolutionary gene-editing technology adapted from a natural defense system in bacteria. Bacteria use CRISPR-associated proteins, like Cas9, to find and chop up the DNA of invading viruses. Scientists have harnessed this system to create a tool that can be programmed to find a specific DNA sequence inside a cell and then make a precise cut. This allows researchers to add, remove, or alter genetic material at particular locations in the genome. It is faster, cheaper, more accurate, and more efficient than other existing genome editing methods.",

The concept was articulated by mythologist Joseph Campbell in his book 'The Hero with a Thousand Faces' (1949). He argued that countless myths and stories from around the world follow this fundamental structure. The journey is typically broken down into several stages, such as the Call to Adventure, the Refusal of the Call, Meeting the Mentor, Crossing the Threshold, Tests, Allies, and Enemies, the Ordeal, and the Return with the Elixir.",
