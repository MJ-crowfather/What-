## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Depends on category (Science: #66BB6A, History: #EF5350, IR: #AB47BC, Tech: #42A5F5, Literature: #8D6E63).
- Background color: Desaturated shade of the category's primary color. Example, for Science, background is #E0F2E6.
- Accent color: An analogous color to the primary, creating contrast. Example: for Science, a yellow-green.
- Headline Font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for the 'What?' title and concept headings; lends a bold, retro feel.
- Body Font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for concept descriptions and TL;DR; offers a clean, readable experience.
- Boxy and minimal: use sharp edges and rectangular shapes.
- Blocky slide/fade transitions reminiscent of 80s computer UI.
